		<!--<h3>Golden Circle</h3>-->
		<!--<ol>-->
			<!--<li>1. Why? - I want to find a meaningful passion that uses problem solving and a set of skills but is constantly evolving.</li>-->
			<!--<li>2. How? - coding</li>-->

		<!--<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>-->
		<!--<p>I am people oriented and enjoy forming new relationships with people,-->
			<!--but I also enjoy working with numbers and logic. I think that my time at St. John's-->
			<!--combined the different parts of the brain well especially in the geometry class. The way that-->
			<!--St. John's was structured meant that we had to learn how to present a math proof in front of-->
			<!--our class - essentially we had to memorize and fully understand the logic as well-->
			<!--as understanding how best to convey this to our fellow students.</p>-->
		<!--<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>-->

		<!--<p>Hi, I'm Mary. I do front end development. I enjoy problem solving and working with what's in front of me-->
		<!--in order to make a more enjoyable site. How? Oh, well I have learned coding from deep dive, yes indeed.-->
		<!--Let's go out for coffee and chat.</p>-->

			<h2>Homework Activities</h2>
			<h3>Board Game Team Dynamics</h3>
			<p>I felt like I noticed myself wanting to boss people around and had to make sure that I wasn't overbearing or giving completely unwanted advice. All in all I think we worked really well together and each had different strenghts.</p>
			<h3>3 Indirect Initiatives</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make business cards and leave them places/give them to people I know who are related to the tech/web design industry.</li>
				<li>Create web pages for people I know and ask them to refer others to me</li>
				<li>Create my own website and make sure it can be seen</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>3 Direct initiatives</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Go to tech events and approach people there</li>
				<li>Approach people and companies I'm interested in working for</li>
				<li>Approach people I don't know in order to create their website</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Worth Questions</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?
				<ul>
				<li>I don't think I'm very ambitious - or it might be that I don't have a good, tangible, goal to be ambitious about.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>How do you personally create value for others?
				<ul>
					<li>I like to do small, fun things without being asked.</li>
					<li>I also believe in being kind rather than being nice.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential professionally? Do you believe it? Why, why not?
				<ul>
					<li>Yes, I've been told that. It's hard to know what it would mean out of context, but I think that I'm smart and very able to learn. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Two Organizations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Tokyo Cafe</li>
				<li>Joy of Glass</li>
			</ul>

				<li>earned two promotions in three years</li>

		<!--<h3>Golden Circle</h3>-->
		<!--<ol>-->
			<!--<li>1. Why? - I want to find a meaningful passion that uses problem solving and a set of skills but is constantly evolving.</li>-->
			<!--<li>2. How? - coding</li>-->
			<!--<li>3. What? - Finding what kind of coding I'd like to stick with and working in a workplace as a developer.</li>-->
		<!--</ol>-->
		<!--<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>-->
		<!--<p>I am people oriented and enjoy forming new relationships with people,-->
			<!--but I also enjoy working with numbers and logic. I think that my time at St. John's-->
			<!--combined the different parts of the brain well especially in the geometry class. The way that-->
			<!--St. John's was structured meant that we had to learn how to present a math proof in front of-->
			<!--our class - essentially we had to memorize and fully understand the logic as well-->
			<!--as understanding how best to convey this to our fellow students.</p>-->
		<!--<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>-->
		<!--<h4>Version One</h4>-->
		<!--<p>Hi, I'm Mary. I do front end development. I enjoy problem solving and working with what's in front of me-->
		<!--in order to make a more enjoyable site. How? Oh, well I have learned coding from deep dive, yes indeed.-->
		<!--Let's go out for coffee and chat.</p>-->
		<!--<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>-->
		<!--<h3>Week 1</h3>-->
		<!--<p>Dear diary, etc, etc, etc.</p>-->
		<!--<h3>Week 2</h3>-->
		<!--<p>one two three four five six, latin.</p>-->

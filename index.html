		<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
		<p>I am people oriented and enjoy forming new relationships with people,
			but I also enjoy working with numbers and logic. I think that my time at St. John's
			combined the different parts of the brain well especially in the geometry class. The way that
			St. John's was structured meant that we had to learn how to present a math proof in front of
			our class - essentially we had to memorize and fully understand the logic as well
			as understanding how best to convey this to our fellow students.</p>

    <h3>Golden Circle</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Why? - I want to find a meaningful passion that uses problem solving and a set of skills but is constantly evolving.</li>
        <li>2. How? - coding</li>
        <li>3. What? - Finding what kind of coding I'd like to stick with and working in a workplace as a developer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
    <p>I am people oriented and enjoy forming new relationships with people,
        but I also enjoy working with numbers and logic. I think that my time at St. John's
        combined the different parts of the brain well especially in the geometry class. The way that
        St. John's was structured meant that we had to learn how to present a math proof in front of
        our class - essentially we had to memorize and fully understand the logic as well
        as understanding how best to convey this to our fellow students.</p>
    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
    <h4>Version One</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mary. I do front end development. I enjoy problem solving and working with what's in front of me in order to make a more enjoyable site. How? Oh, well I have learned coding from deep dive, yes indeed. Let's go out for coffee and chat.</p>
    <h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far! It's tiring because of my schedule but it's not mentally exhausting in the way I was worried it would be. I'm having so much trouble thinking of what I want to do once I leave though. I'd be happy to have a job in front or back end I think, but I don't have a longterm goal.</p>
    <p>I need to work on my elevator pitch but I'm not sure how without having a specific goal. I especially don't know how to come up with my "why" when I don't yet have a "what".</p>
    <h3>Week 2</h3>

    <h3>Golden Circle</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Why? - To cultivate an environment where people can learn from their mistakes without judgement so that they can grow in a genuine and successful way.</li>
        <li>2. How? - coding</li>
        <li>3. What? - Using development to make websites more accessible and user friendly so that they help learning rather than prohibit it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
    <p>I am people oriented and enjoy forming new relationships with people,
        but I also enjoy working with numbers and logic. I think that my time at St. John's
        combined the different parts of the brain well especially in the geometry class. The way that
        St. John's was structured meant that we had to learn how to present a math proof in front of
        our class - essentially we had to memorize and fully understand the logic as well
        as understanding how best to convey this to our fellow students.</p>
    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
    <h4>Version One</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mary. I do front end development. My goal is to create environments where people can learn from their mistakes and grow successfully. In order to do this I make websites more user friendly and accessible. Let's go out for coffee and chat.</p>
    <h4>Version Two</h4>
    <!--<p>Hi, I'm Mary. I am a junior developer focusing on optimization and creating structures. I work primarily with javascript and css. What are you working on?</p>-->
    <!--<h4>Version Three</h4>-->
    <p>Hi, I'm Mary. I'm a junior developer focusing on optimization. My goal is to not only get websites up and running, but to get them up and running well. I'd love to see what you're working on.</p>
    <h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far! It's tiring because of my schedule but it's not mentally exhausting in the way I was worried it would be. I'm having so much trouble thinking of what I want to do once I leave though. I'd be happy to have a job in front or back end I think, but I don't have a longterm goal.</p>
    <p>I need to work on my elevator pitch but I'm not sure how without having a specific goal. I especially don't know how to come up with my "why" when I don't yet have a "what".</p>
    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>What's a good way to create an elevator pitch if we don't particularly want to start our own business or create our own app?</p>
    <p>I think I've found my why. Possibly. I spent some time over the weekend trying to figure it out and I've at least got something that makes sense.</p>
    <p>I'm still really enjoying the bootcamp, but the second week was much more challenging than the first. It wasn't helped by missing an afternoon session due to a doctor's appointment.</p>
    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    <p>I never know what day of the week it is anymore. So that can be kind of weird. I'm still enjoying it but I'm a little worried about being tested on things.</p>
    <p>I'm really excited about my capstone group! I think it'll be great. It was my first choice of project and I like all the group members as well.</p>
    <h3>Week 4</h3>
    <p>I'm loving my capstone group and project. Hopefully we make a good web app that actually functions how we hope. I also hope that we have time to do our "stretch goal"; based on our time management so far it doesn't seem like too much of a stretch.</p>
    <p>I also hung out with the capstone group outside of class (for our assignment) and we had a great time. It's nice to know that we get along even when we don't have to. I also worked outside of class with a few people which was fun and a kind of new experience - since I live in Santa Fe I haven't been spending much time in ABQ outside of class and it was a nice change of pace.</p>
    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    <p>Good week! I loved unit testing a lot! It was awesome. I also liked the guest speakers this week. Matterform seems like a great place to work. Oh, I guess I did have my first little breakdown about javascript. Because I wasn't able to do this homework on the train (where I do 90% of my homework) not having enough of a heads up to allow me to budget my time made completing the javascript challenge really difficult and stressful. It also made it more frustrating because I think if I had more time on it I would have loved working with javascript. So one of my goals is to look more at javascript in my spare time (lol).</p>
    <h3>Week 6</h3>
    <p>This week felt longer and the bridge felt more scattered. Our capstone group is still getting along well but we did very little work on our project since our tickets were ready to be burned days before it was done and we were given new tickets. I'm making very slow progress on my PWP and I think part of the issue is that I just keep looking at the same thing and it's starting to look fake and ugly. I feel like I need to redesign it.</p>
    <p>I still haven't practiced JavaScript in my own time and it's frustrating to know that I won't learn it at all if I don't learn it on my own. I feel kind of lied to. The website says this boot camp "focuses on" JavaScript and we literally had a single assignment that I had less than two hours to work on due to my commute. Maybe it's something that will come up again later in our capstone, but, honestly, I doubt it.</p>

    <h2>final reflections</h2>
    <p>i had a good time. thank you erin for our socks!!! i love my team. wish we learned more javascript. i like our end result to our capstone and my final pwp. will definitely work more on both later. also will probably update my business cards to match my pwp. beepboop.</p>
    <p>dan wants to hear about those pictures we picked. i picked birds. i feel kinda like i have spread my wings so that's good?</p>
    <h4>self reflection</h4>
    <p>i can be kinda bossy but i knew that. i'm usually good at interacting with a team even if i don't like them, but luckily i loved my team this time. i don't like to take breaks based on how long i've been working - i like to take a break when i feel like i've accomplished something and come to a natural stopping point. this can be good and bad. sometimes you just need to get away from things. i also need to be around a group of people who like to laugh - otherwise i feel sad and unfulfilled.</p>

    <h3>Reflection on Self Google</h3>
    <p>Not much pops up very quickly. You can find my facebook very soon which includes my maiden name as well. If you google Mary Schmitt based on that you find a lot of stuff about a body builder who is definitely not me. Anything else under that name is completely buried under her web presence.</p>
    <p>I'm a bit embarrassed that if you click through google pages long enough you find a gofundme that I started, but that's not bad press so much as personally slightly embarrassing.</p>

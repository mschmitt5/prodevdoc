    <h3>Golden Circle</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Why? - To cultivate an environment where people can learn from their mistakes without judgement so that they can grow in a genuine and successful way.</li>
        <li>2. How? - coding</li>
        <li>3. What? - Using development to make websites more accessible and user friendly so that they help learning rather than prohibit it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
    <p>I am people oriented and enjoy forming new relationships with people,
        but I also enjoy working with numbers and logic. I think that my time at St. John's
        combined the different parts of the brain well especially in the geometry class. The way that
        St. John's was structured meant that we had to learn how to present a math proof in front of
        our class - essentially we had to memorize and fully understand the logic as well
        as understanding how best to convey this to our fellow students.</p>
    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
    <h4>Version One</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mary. I do front end development. My goal is to create environments where people can learn from their mistakes and grow successfully. In order to do this I make websites more user friendly and accessible. Let's go out for coffee and chat.</p>
    <h4>Version Two</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mary. I am a junior developer focusing on optimization and creating structures. I work primarily with javascript and css. What are you working on?</p>
    <h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>I'm really enjoying the bootcamp so far! It's tiring because of my schedule but it's not mentally exhausting in the way I was worried it would be. I'm having so much trouble thinking of what I want to do once I leave though. I'd be happy to have a job in front or back end I think, but I don't have a longterm goal.</p>
    <p>I need to work on my elevator pitch but I'm not sure how without having a specific goal. I especially don't know how to come up with my "why" when I don't yet have a "what".</p>
    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>What's a good way to create an elevator pitch if we don't particularly want to start our own business or create our own app?</p>
    <p>I think I've found my why. Possibly. I spent some time over the weekend trying to figure it out and I've at least got something that makes sense.</p>
    <p>I'm still really enjoying the bootcamp, but the second week was much more challenging than the first. It wasn't helped by missing an afternoon session due to a doctor's appointment.</p>
    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    <p>I never know what day of the week it is anymore. So that can be kind of weird. I'm still enjoying it but I'm a little worried about being tested on things.</p>
    <p>I'm really excited about my capstone group! I think it'll be great. It was my first choice of project and I like all the group members as well.</p>
    <h3>Week 4</h3>
    <p>I'm loving my capstone group and project. Hopefully we make a good web app that actually funtions how we hope. I also hope that we have time to do our "stretch goal"; based on our time management so far it doesn't seem like too much of a stretch.</p>
    <p>I also hung out with the capstone group outside of class (for our assignment) and we had a great time. It's nice to know that we get along even when we don't have to. I also worked outside of class with a few people which was fun and a kind of new experience - since I live in Santa Fe I haven't been spending much time in ABQ outside of class and it was a nice change of pace.</p>
    <h3>Reflection on Self Google</h3>
    <p>Not much pops up very quickly. You can find my facebook very soon which includes my maiden name as well. If you google Mary Schmitt based on that you find a lot of stuff about a body builder who is definitely not me. Anything else under that name is completely buried under her web presence.</p>
    <p>I'm a bit embarrassed that if you click through google pages long enough you find a gofundme that I started, but that's not bad press so much as personally slightly embarrassing.</p>
